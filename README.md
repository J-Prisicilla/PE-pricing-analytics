by Katrien Antonio, Roel Henckaerts and Roel Verbelen.

Course materials for the *Pricing analytics in R* course in March 2020
in Leuven and Brussels.

üìÜ March, 2020 <br> üïñ approx. 3h <br> üìç IA|BE in Brussels, Data science
for non-life insurance class at KU Leuven

## Goals of the workshop

You‚Äôll work through the essential steps of the implementation in `R` of
the pricing framework proposed in the paper ‚ÄúA data driven binning
strategy for the construction of insurance tariff classes‚Äù, by
Henckaerts, Antonio, Clijsters and Verbelen in Scandinavian Actuarial
Journal (2018). The methodology is illustrated with the same data set as
the one used by Henckaerts et al.¬†(2018).

This paper develops a fully data driven strategy to incorporate
continuous risk factors and geographical information in an insurance
tariff. The framework nicely aligns flexibility with the practical
requirements of an insurance company, the policyholder and the
regulator. The approach combines tools from statistical learning (GAMs,
GLMs) with machine learning (clustering, evolutionary trees).

## Schedule and Course Material

You can access the lecture sheets via
[pricing-analytics-sheets](https://katrienantonio.github.io/PE-pricing-analytics/sheets/pricing_analytics_with_GAMs_and_GLMs.html).
These are under construction and will be updated\!

An older documentation of the same workshop is
[here](https://katrienantonio.github.io/PE-pricing-analytics/background/2019_04_APC_Pricing_analytics_in_R.html).

## Software requirements

Please bring a laptop with a recent version of R and RStudio installed.
Make sure you can connect your laptop to the internet (or download the
course material one day before the start of the workshop). You will
need:

  - R (at least 3.5.2 <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> )
  - RStudio (
    <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> )

You should install and load the packages that will be used throughout
the workshop. You can use the following instructions to install (if
necessary) and load the packages. These instructions are also available
in `prework_installation_packages.R` from the `scripts` folder.

``` r
packages <- c("tidyverse", "mgcv", "evtree", "classInt", "rgdal", "RColorBrewer", "grid", "gridExtra", "visreg", "sf", "tmap", "rgeos", "mapview", "leaflet")
suppressMessages(packages <- lapply(packages, FUN = function(x) {
  if (!require(x, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(x)
    library(x, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}))
```

## RStudio Cloud

We provide a back-up plan in case your local installation of R (and the
necessary packages) is not working properly. Please join our project on
RStudio Cloud via the following link

<https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/55584/join?access_code=hnHmPmSNsbu8BdEBJkeMXNPtHBelpnnJBAmF9XTH>

After creating an account for RStudio you will be able to work with the
scripts and data sets in the cloud.
